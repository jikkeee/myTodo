checkout my repo jikkeee @ github
I implemented the logic on my own using the UI from codeexplained tutorial on youtube, you may want to check him out.

The To-do list app utilizes DOM to accomplish the following:
    - display current date and time according to user's machine.
    - Add to do item by clicking plus icon or pressing enter.
    - Delete to do item by clicking trash icon.
    - reset to do by clicking reset button at top right corner.
    - to do list is stored in localStorage so user can refresh without losing data.

To store to local storage I utilized the localStorage API check MDN docs for more reference
The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user, for that we're using a method called toLocaleDateString, which you can read about here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString
